# Report for Neuron Activity of Mice 

This report delves into an analysis of neuron activity in the brains of mice during decision-making processes, using data from an experiment conducted by Steinmetz et al. (2019). Focusing on 18 sessions from the original 39, corresponding to four distinct mice (Cori, Forssmann, Hench, and Lederberg), we investigate how various brain regions and neuron spike counts contribute to decision-making. Through exploratory data analysis, we scrutinize the structure and key features of the data set, which includes neuron spike data, contrast levels of stimuli, and resultant mouse decisions. Our predictive modeling endeavors to ascertain the factors influencing the mice decisions, underpinned by the hypothesis that specific brain areas and spike numbers are pivotal. Employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we reduce data dimension to enhance our model's interpretability, focusing on the components that capture the most variance. The culmination of our analysis is a predictive model that achieves a 72.5% accuracy rate in forecasting the mice's decisions, offering insights into the neural underpinnings of decision-making processes in mice and potentially broadening our understanding of brain functionality.
